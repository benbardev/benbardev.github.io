<div style="text-align: justify"> As an ocean scientist turned data scientist, I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to solve complex problems. My background in oceanography has given me a strong foundation in scientific research methods, data modelling, and analysis. Through my transition to data science, I have gained experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I am excited to apply these skills to a variety of industries and use data to drive innovation and positive change. </div>


### My story
<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a coastal ocean modeller at the National Oceanography Centre, UK. I have expertise in scientific data analysis and pre-processing data for models. I work on performing numerical simulations of ocean using high performace computing clusters. </div> 
<div style="text-align: justify"> My background is in Arctic Ocean Physics and I completed a PhD in this in 2019. During the PhD project I used principal component analysis to identify clusters of data points that showed similar spatio-temporal patterns of variability. I also built a regression model to combine satellite data into a new variable. Previously I </div> 

### How I've grown
<div style="text-align: justify"> I've undergone a significant professional evolution, transitioning from a career in ocean science to data science. This transition has required me to develop new skills, broaden my knowledge base, and adapt to a new field.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> I have developed my skills, such as Python programming, machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> I have gained new knowledge about data science concepts, tools, and methodologies. I have taken the FastAI course and the Amazon Web Services: Machine Learning course. These courses have given me certifications in data science techniques and enabled me to develpe the projects in this portfolio. </div>
