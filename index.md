### My mission

<div style="text-align: justify"> As an ocean scientist turned data scientist, I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to solve complex problems. My background in oceanography has given me a strong foundation in scientific research methods, data modelling, and analysis. Through my transition to data science, I have gained experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualisation. I am excited to apply these skills to a variety of industries and use data to drive innovation and positive change. </div>

<br/>
### My story
<div style="text-align: justify"> At present, I am a Coastal Ocean Modeller at the National Oceanography Centre, UK. I have expertise in scientific data analysis, pre-processing data for models and performing numerical simulations of the ocean using high performance computing clusters. This has resulted in an extensive production run of the Scottish Shelf Water Reanalysis Service used by over 50 clients in various industries. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> My background includes a PhD in Arctic Ocean Physics in 2019. During the PhD project I used principal component analysis to identify clusters of data points that showed similar spatio-temporal patterns of variability. This contributed to a convincing argument on the ocean being a source of heat to the Barents Sea in a highly cited journal article. I also built a regression model to combine satellite data into a new variable. This used novel techniques to produce a new remote way of measuring the freshwater content of the Barents Sea. Previously I worked at a metocean consultancy where I produced informative reports that allowed clients to make high level decisions about servicing offshore installations and shipping channels. </div>

<br/>
### How I've grown
<div style="text-align: justify"> I've undergone a significant professional evolution, transitioning from a career in ocean science towards data science. This transition has required me to develop new skills, broaden my knowledge base, and adapt to a new field with different project requirements.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> I have developed my skills, such as Python programming, machine learning and neural networks, data analysis, and data visualisation.</div>
* <div style="text-align: justify"> I have gained new knowledge about data science concepts, tools, and methodologies. I have taken the FastAI course and the Amazon Web Services: Machine Learning course. These courses have given me certifications in data science techniques and enabled me to develop the projects in this portfolio. </div>

### What I offer

I offer my services as a freelance Data Scientist to solve problems using data and increase efficiency in your work, saving you time. I have experience working with environmental data such as weather and could easily bring this extra dimension into your project.
