As an ocean scientist turned data scientist, I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to solve complex problems. My background in oceanography has given me a strong foundation in scientific research methods, data collection, and analysis. Through my transition to data science, I have gained experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I am excited to apply these skills to a variety of industries and use data to drive innovation and positive change.
