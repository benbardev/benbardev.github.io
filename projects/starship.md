## Starship Titanic

This project is based on solving the Kaggle competition problem Starship Titanic. The main Kaggle competition page can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview)

Summary: To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.

My code uses an ensamble of a Random Forest and a Neural Network. The data was cleaned by removing columns that did not improve the model. Gaps in the dataset were iteratively filled using predictions from the Random Forest.
